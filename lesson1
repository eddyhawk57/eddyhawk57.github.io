    <h1>Lesson 1: What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines. These machines are designed to think, learn, and make decisions like humans — or even better in some cases. AI is not just a futuristic concept; it's already present in tools like voice assistants, search engines, social media, and self-driving cars.
    </p>

    <h2>What AI Is and Isn't</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>AI is</strong> the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, recognizing patterns, and adapting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>AI isn't</strong> magic or human-like consciousness. Machines don’t think or feel — they follow mathematical models and data.
    </p>

    <h2>Main Types of AI</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Narrow AI</strong> – Performs specific tasks (e.g., facial recognition, chatbots). This is what we use today.</li>
      <li><strong>General AI</strong> – A hypothetical system that could handle any human task. We haven't achieved this yet.</li>
      <li><strong>Superintelligent AI</strong> – A concept from science fiction where AI surpasses all human intelligence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why AI Matters Today</h2>
    <p>
      AI is behind powerful tools like Google Search, YouTube recommendations, chatbots, and facial recognition. It's revolutionizing industries — from healthcare and finance to retail and transportation. Learning AI can lead to high-paying jobs and impactful innovation.
    </p>

    <h2>How AI Works (Simplified)</h2>
    <p>
      AI uses <strong>data</strong> and <strong>algorithms</strong> to recognize patterns and make predictions. Here's how:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data</strong> – The fuel that powers AI (text, images, numbers, etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>Algorithms</strong> – The rules or models that learn from the data</li>
      <li><strong>Training</strong> – The process of feeding data into algorithms to make them smarter over time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>YouTube</strong> recommending videos based on your viewing history</li>
      <li><strong>Google Translate</strong> converting text between languages</li>
      <li><strong>Self-driving cars</strong> recognizing traffic signs and obstacles in real time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      AI is not just the future — it's already here. In this course, you’ll learn everything from the basics to advanced techniques and even how to monetize your AI skills. Let’s get started!
